## Project Outcomes
 
 Cluster Analysis: The K-means clustering algorithm identified four distinct clusters within the dataset. Each cluster represents a different group of customers with distinct purchasing behaviors. Cluster 0 (about 40% of the data) comprises customers with lower spending on most product categories, while Cluster 1 (about 26% of the data) consists of high-spenders on Fresh, Milk, and Grocery. Cluster 2 (about 25% of the data) represents customers with moderate spending across various product categories, and Cluster 3 (about 9% of the data) includes customers with high spending on Milk, Grocery, and Detergents_Paper.

Outlier Detection: Through the exploratory data analysis, we identified and handled outliers for each feature separately. Outliers were present in several product categories, such as Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen. The outlier handling process involved capping the extreme values, which helped in stabilizing the clusters and improving the quality of the clustering results.

Data Dimensionality Reduction: The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the most important information. The first two principal components explained around 93% of the total variance in the data. The visualization of the clustered data in the 2D PCA space revealed clear separation among the clusters, indicating that the chosen features captured relevant information for the clustering task.

Customer Segmentation: The clustering analysis provided valuable insights into customer segmentation, allowing the wholesale distributor to understand and target different customer groups effectively. By tailoring marketing strategies and product offerings to the specific needs of each cluster, the distributor can enhance customer satisfaction and optimize their supply chain management.

### Project Description:
In this project, we applyed unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project involves the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We imported and cleaned the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
-	Unsupervised learning: We used the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together and also determined the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked."
